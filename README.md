# RefConnect

*RefConnect* is a communication application for volunteers to easily find what kind of help is needed for the refugees in Europe and where it is needed at.
Once the user finds an issue that they are able to help, they can contact the user who has posted the issue, to discuss how they are able to help 


This project was developed during HackLondon (Feb 2016)
